## Overview
Avatar Arena is a simple web-based 1v1 fighting game.  Pick from the Knight,
Mage or Rogue classes, each with their own stats and special move.  Battles are
turn based and award coins that can be spent in the shop on weapons, armor and
artifacts.  Items have rarity tiers and hovering over a shop button shows a
preview of a random piece of gear.  Winning fights grants experience to level up
your avatar and you can challenge a boss once you are ready.  Background colors
change based on the selected avatar to add a bit of personality.
