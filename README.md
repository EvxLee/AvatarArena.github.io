## Overview
Avatar Arena is a simple browser-based 1v1 fighter AI-assisted game project
built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Pick the Knight, Mage, or Rogue, each 
with unique stats and a special move that costs energy. Battles are turn-based
and award coins to spend in the shop on weapons, armor and artifacts.
Items have rarity tiers and hovering a shop button shows a
random piece of gear. Winning fights grants experience to level up your
avatar and you can challenge a boss when ready. Your progress is saved
locally and backgrounds shift to match your chosen class.
